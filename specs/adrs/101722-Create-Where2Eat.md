# Create a Food Journal App

## Context and Problem Statement

Need to create an app that solves a current issue and is focused on user content.

Need to create a local-first CRUD web app.

App should be simple enough to be completed in a few weeks by college students (not full-timers).

## Considered Options

* Messaging app
* Journaling app / bullet journal
* Reminder app / goal oriented app
* Navigation app
* Trip planner
* Food journal

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 

"Food journal", because it is focused on user content and solves a current, universal issue. Most people have experienced having difficulties in deciding on where to eat, at least once in their lifetimes. It would be nice to have an app that helps keep track of personal experiences and decide on the best place to eat. It is a CRUD app that can be build as local-first, and it's fundamental features are not too complicated to build with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript knowledge gained through CSE 110. The name "Where2Eat" draws inspiration from "When2Meet", a web app that helps users decide on the best time for a group to meet.
