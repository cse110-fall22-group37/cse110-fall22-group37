#Export-button

## Context and Problem Statement

How to share with others quickly about your experience, ideas and thoughts on a restuarant?
How to make it as easy as possible for the user to share this information?

## Considered options

*web-based messaging
*emailing list
*saving the list as a pdf

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: We chose the export button to be a saved pdf of the user's list. This is because there are uses of the list aside from sharing with friends.
In this way, it is offline first and the user can save the list for his orher purposes in the future or share them to their friends if they want to.
Although directly messaging or emailing the list may be useful, it is important to us that the user experience is as simple and easy as possible.
This feature allows the user to save their list in their local device in just a click of a button.
