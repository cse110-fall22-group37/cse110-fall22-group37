# Include search bar and price/ratings sorting options

## Context and Problem Statement

How to quickly find a specific restaurant entry in a long list?
How to present entries based on user's budget and past experience?
How to make it as easy as possible for the user to find a restaurant to eat at?

## Considered Options

* Search bar and sorting based on price/ratings
* Show restaurants based on selected tags
* Filter restaurants based on specific price/rating values

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Include a search bar and have the options to organize the list by price and/or rating. We chose this because the search bar allows users to quickly locate the exact restaurant entry they are looking for. The price/rating sorting options are helpful for when users do not have a specific restaurant in mind, but they want to go somewhere budget-friendly, or somewhere they will most likely have a good experience at, based on the past. This customization is crucial in allowing the users to find the right restaurant(s) to go to in an efficient and personal way.
