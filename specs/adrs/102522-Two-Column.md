# Single-page, Two-column Layout

## Context and Problem Statement

Need to display user's saved restaurants conveniently.

The user can add/edit their restaurants conveniently.

## Considered Options

* Single view of user's saved restaurants. Add/edit restaurant in pop-up window.
* Single view of user's saved restaurants. Add/edit restaurant in a different page.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Single page & Two column. 

It avoids using a pop-up window, which is very tricky to implement in plain HTML, CSS and JS. 
It avoids user from having to switch into a different page to add/edit their restaurants.
