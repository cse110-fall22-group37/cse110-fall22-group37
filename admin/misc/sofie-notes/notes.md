10/23/22 Pitfalls and risks
- too many features, the users may be overwhelmed
- service being slow from backend
- too many features we cannot finish
- password management and security if they have an account
- user security for account
- number of factors can label restaurants and search by 


10/23/22  Shape Up Book Notes
- do 6 week cycles, short enough can see deadline but do meaningful work
- shape the work before giving to a team, define key elements,
- focus on appetite, how much time, is idea worth it
- give full responsibility to a small team
- target the risk of not shipping on time
- shaping, betting, building
### shaping
- overspecifying the design can cause complexity
- underspecifying cause issues
- compromise for use case
- need to bound it
- 4 steps: set boundaries, rough out elemtns, addreess risks and rabbit holes, write the pitch
- boundaries
fixed time variable scope 
narrow the problem
define the problem
watch for grab bags, redesigning just because
breadboarding
what are the steps
look for rabbit holes:
how would a user get from start to end
are we assuming how parts come together
patch the holes
declare out of bounds
cut back things not necessary to the core
- write a pitch 5 things
1. problem- the raw idea, use case
2. appetite - how much time want to spend on solution
3. solution, the core elements came up with 
4. rabbit holes, details about solution worth calling out
5. No gos- anything specifically excluded

### Bets
decentralized lists
6 week cycles, cool down
small teams
betting table, meeting to decide what to do in next cycle
commitness 
when make a bet you honor it
cant solve all bugs
bring to betting table
do a bug smasg
keep slate clean
only bet one cycle at a time
do research and development
producgtion mode
cleanup mode
questions to ask: does the problme matter, is the solution attractivr, 
is the appetite right

### Building
be oriented
tasks we come up with and some come up
do real work
do one slice with backend and front end, make it work, then continue
doesnt need to be all or nothing
start in the middle at the core
start small
be novel
organize b structure not person
scope map, meaningful part of problems
chowder list for loose things that done fit
mark nice to haves vs must haves
build way uphill in figuring out what to do and then doing it
decide when to stop, compare to baseline
have limits
move on











Meeting 10/19 assorted notes from talking to our TA Allison

Focus on individual users first, main point person to know, personal yelp 

Problem: you do not know where you want to eat 
Categories, near me, type of food
Multiple queues
Focus on one and add others later 
Use javascript to store
Serialize and store 
Cannot avoid, even if insert , whole object 
To store in local storage not in memory, if shut down memory is gone, need put in local storage, 
Sort when needs to be sorted as supposed to priority queue, with sorting also
When deep in code 
Features have strong reasoning, answers to questions might have before 
What would the user see when first u\open map 
Answers user experience ,  micro board
Branding between tea and location 
When pin the app to taskbar , recognize app opening, without reading 
Team logo can be different from app logo
Black and orange 
We can change 
Put credit and verify allow 
If going to use Creative Commons to read over the license docs and make sure if a business and make sure can use 
Stock photos
Read it, note that , as practice, paid enterprise much more 
How do I choose restaurants how do I food want to eat, outing for a day, along driving route, do they want be able to get take out to take with them
Diner or fancy restaurant 
Different ways people make decisions in way cater to 
Using data have locally and later adding in the ask google maps api for location of place and store locally

Local first app is obsidian markdown notes, text files, 
Automatic backups to a GitHub
Text files can manipulate 
What might be useful 
Sometimes what’s useful is simple really convent Swiss Army knife for this 
Pick and choose which citation managers
Which one choose 

I dont like this app
Distill down and say why do I like about Facebook vs twitter vs instagram
What makes me like this game vs this game
Drawing tablet over a pencil
Descriptive and detailed as possible 
They added this thing in software
They added this thing very friendly 

Small does not ned to be the best will grow complicated
How do I handle 
Icing on top
Live collaboration, very hard 
File storage consistency, who’s change persist, and merge, 
Make sure works as a local service if turn wifi off above all else works beautifully when turn off wifi and then add compare with friends 
Wireframes
Grab every step of what see what use 
When I dsaidf I want to choose restaurant range in each is workflow
First click this then input this
High fidelity diagram, first this then this 
Define behavior
Wire frame and pitch 
Organize idea and figure how fit 
Sort into structure 
Sigma
Actions happen, 
Button more convenient
Customizable 
Optional and not in game plan
