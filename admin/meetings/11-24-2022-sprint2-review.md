# Sprint 2 Review

### Learning what can and cannot or should or should not:
- Should test while we implement things
- Documentation needs to be clear to communicate

<br>

### CI/CD
- linting is working
- Codacy is working
- Unit tests work
- Js docs is working locally but we still need to fix the workflow
<br>

### Main changes
- Added edit, delete, Filter Tags and Clear
<br>

### Have simplified the code to fewer files
