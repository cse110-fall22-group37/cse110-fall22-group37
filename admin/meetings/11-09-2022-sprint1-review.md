# Sprint 1 Review

### Learning what can and cannot or should or should not:
- Can reuse the code
- Can break things if separate them

<br>

### CI/CD
- linting is working
- Codacy is working
- Unit tests work
- Js docs not working need to be applied, downloaded need to be applied
<br>

### Added the restaurant entry proper code
- Renamed the code
<br>

### Will make one main file to simplify, too many files too much complexity
